<h3> 1 Kings 3:5-10</h3>

<p><blockquote><b>(5) At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said,
"Ask! What shall I give you?" (6) And Solomon said: "You have shown great mercy
to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in
righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great
kindness for him, and You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
(7) Now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father
David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. (8) And Your
servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too
numerous to be numbered or counted. (9) Therefore give to Your servant an
understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and
evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?" (10) The speech pleased
the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</b></blockquote></p>

<p><i><b>New King James Version</b></i></p>

<p>Did anyone ever have such a good start as Solomon? Perhaps the outstanding thing
was his attitude when he asked this of God. Commentators feel that he was somewhere
around twenty years old when this occurred. His youthfulness shows in what he felt
about himself in relation to what had become his responsibility. He says, "I am a little
child. I do not know how to go out or come in." In other words, "I don't know how to
conduct the affairs of office. I feel that I am not adequate to do the job that has been
given to me."</p>

<p>He began with such promise, and maybe most of all was that wonderful attitude. It was
childlike. He was humble, willing to listen, willing to be admonished and commanded by God Did

<p>He began with such promise, and maybe most of all was that wonderful attitude. It was
childlike. He was humble, willing to listen, willing to be admonished and commanded by
God. This is why God responded as He did.
Jesus Christ said, "To whom much is given, from him much will be required." Very few
have ever been given as much as Solomon had. So, he is an excellent study case of
one who neglected his gifts in favor of something of lesser value. The cause of his fall is
here summarized in I Kings 11:1-10.<p>
God. This is why God responded as He did.
Jesus Christ said, "To whom much is given, from him much will be required." Very few
have ever been given as much as Solomon had. So, he is an excellent study case of
one who neglected his gifts in favor of something of lesser value. The cause of his fall is
here summarized in I Kings 11:1-10. occur. A similar thing happened to Solomon. When we add what is taught in II
Thessalonians, we find that the blindness is, in reality, self-imposed.</p>

<p>God did not make Solomon blind, and He will not make the people spoken of in II
Thessalonians 2 blind either. But, because of their behavior, neither will He stop their
progression towards it. It is not that the people utterly refuse to accept truth—just as
Solomon never renounced God. The problem is that they do not love it!
The problem is one of dedication. What was Solomon dedicated to? He was not
dedicated to God for very long after his good beginning. He was dedicated to his
projects—to building Jerusalem, the Temple, his home, botanical gardens—things that
only expanded his overwhelming vanity.
He ignored the laws God gave for kings
 (Deuteronomy 17:14-20), and that was sin.<p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, unlike David, Solomon did not have the spiritual resources to recover
from what he did. David recovered when he sinned because he had a relationship with
God. Even though he sinned, he would bounce back from it in repentance.</p>

<p>I Kings 11:4 says that Solomon "clung to" his wives. Normally, that would be good. A
man should cling or cleave to his wife. Solomon, though, cleaved to the wrong women,
and his attachment to them led him astray. As he tolerated their worship of other gods
right in his home, his resistance wore down, and he became increasingly vulnerable.
Before long, he was participating in the worship of their gods. Once he was accustomed
to it, it wore away his loyalty as each compromise made the next step easier. His vanity
deceived him into feeling that his strength and resolve were so great that he would not
fall. But he did, and he paid a bitter price.</p>

<p>One of the deceptive aspects to what Solomon did is something that any of us could fall
prey to. It does not have to be foreign women or something like an all-consuming hobby.
Religion, however, especially entrapped him through his wives.</p>

<p>Virtually every religion uses similar terminology. Every Christian sect uses the terms
"born again," "salvation," "saved," and "redemption." We could add "justification,"
"mercy," "kindness," "forgiveness," and "grace." All Western religions (and maybe now
even some of these New Age religions) share some of the same terminology, but the
theology behind the terms is radically different.</p>

<p>In Solomon's day, the religions of Ashtoreth, Molech, Baal, Chemosh, and the other
false gods used terminology very similar to what was being used in Israel, but the
theology was vastly different. This is what trapped Solomon. Once a comfortable syncretism is accepted, God is gradually neglected and idolatry is adopted. Thomas
Jefferson is credited with saying, "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance." This is just as
true in regard to religion as it is to civil liberty under a government.</p>
