          <h2>Baptism</h2>
 <p><b>The Baptism of Yeshua and the sermon of Peter concerning baptism.</b></p>
<p>Matthew 3:4-16</p>          
<p>4 Now Yochanan himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. 6 They were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his immersion, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! 9 Don’t think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
10 "Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. 11 I indeed immerse you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
13 Then Yeshua came from Galilee to the Jordan to Yochanan, to be immersed by him. 14 But Yochanan would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be immersed by you, and you come to me?"
15 But Yeshua, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him. 16 Yeshua, when he was immersed, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him. 17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</p>

<p><b>And in the book of Acts Peter preaches to those assembled in Jerusalem thus:</b></p>

<p>Acts 2:29-40
2:29 "Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 2:30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, 2:31 he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay. 2:32 This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses. 2:33 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear. 2:34 For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 
'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand, 
2:35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' 
2:36 “Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." 
2:37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?" 
2:38 Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 2:39 For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself." 2:40 With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"</p> 

<p><b>Now that you have been baptised you now need to receive the Holy Spirit.</b></p>

<p>Acts 8:14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, 8:15 who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; 8:16 for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. 8:17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>
